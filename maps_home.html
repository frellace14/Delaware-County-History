            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The R. L. Barnes Map of 1868 is a rare map not seen often. I recently obtained a copy of the map from a friend. Barnes Map called the &quot; Driving Map of Philadelphia and the Surroundings&quot; is not very detailed but it shows you names you never hear anymore. For example &quot;Wrangletown&quot; the old name for Lima, named for the fights in the local tavern over 150 years ago. Click the above link for a look.</p>

            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;">&nbsp; Sanborn Atlases were originally made in the 1920's and rather than make a new atlas every year the company sent out updates in the form of paper which was cut and pasted on each page depending on new developments etc. Sanborn Atlases were large, the scale was an inch for a 100 feet. It is hard to tell with the Sanborns when they were last updated. Many of the atlases are not marked as to the exact year. They were used till the early 1960's.  </p>
