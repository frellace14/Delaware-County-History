<p align="center">&nbsp; Before September 30, 1885 marriage licenses were not required in Pennsylvania. Licenses were recorded in churches and meeting houses. Besides church records that is about the only place to find marriage records. Occasionally the happy couple put in a announcement in the local newspaper, though not all the time. Recently a friend gave me a copy of research done on the Delaware County Republican Newspaper which was first published in the 1830's. Some one went thru copies of the paper almost 100 years ago and wrote all the marriage licenses that were in the newspaper for Delaware County residents. I and my helpers are starting to type the list now. The list is not complete some newspapers years are missing but there are 1000's of names. This will be a long project, names will be added over the next several months and it will be searchable. Click on the link below for the first few marriages. </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 18th Century Tax Lists on this Web Site took several years to transcribe from 60 year old microfilm. The original records are at the Chester County Archives at West Chester Pa. Delaware County was part of Chester County till 1789. The tax records begin in 1715 and on this site will go to 1850. Right now the tax records go to the year 1816. Many tax records are missing in the 1720's thru the 1740's and some are simply unreadable.Tax records from 1741 thru 1747 are missing along with 1757, 1777 and 1796 thru 1801 with few exceptions. Every effort was made to decipher the names. In all cases, misspellings were corrected. Dix was changed to Dicks and Nuzum changed to Newsome, for example. In some cases names such as Lindsay and Lindsey were left the same, because both spellings were used. Before 1764, only names and tax amounts paid were recorded. Beginning in 1764, acres, slaves and servants and in many cases, occupations were listed for the first time.  The tax lists can be viewed on each Township web page.&nbsp; To get a better understanding of what the numbers etc. mean in the early tax records, click below for more insight.</p>
