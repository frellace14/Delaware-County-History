            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The R. L. Barnes Map of 1868 is a rare map not seen often. I recently obtained a copy of the map from a friend. Barnes Map called the &quot; Driving Map of Philadelphia and the Surroundings&quot; is not very detailed but it shows you names you never hear anymore. For example &quot;Wrangletown&quot; the old name for Lima, named for the fights in the local tavern over 150 years ago. Click the above link for a look.</p>

            <p align="center"><span style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Delaware County 1875 Atlas</strong>:<br />

            </span>The 1875 Atlas of Evererts and Stewart was published just five years after the Hopkin's Atlas. The Atlas reflected the  changes that had occurred in the years from 1870 to 1875, with numerous towns being created do to railroad expansion. The 1875 Atlas Maps are on the site of the Township and Boros on this website. </p>

            <p align="center"><span style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Delaware County 1882 Atlas of early Land Grants and Patents</strong>:<br />

            </span>The Benjamin H. Smith Atlas of early Land Grants and Patents published in Philadelphia by Henry B. Ashmead is one of the rarest Atlas's of Delaware County, Pa. It is put on line here for the first time. Smith spent several years researching Land Grants of William Penn, his sons and others relating to what is now Delaware County. Delaware County was part of Chester County till 1789. The Maps can be found on their Township Web Page.</p>

            <p align="center"><span style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Delaware County 1892 Atlas<br />

Complied from Official Records, private plans and actual surveys by George Wm. Baist, Surveyor and map publisher, 906 Walnut St., Philadelphia, Pa. 1902.

            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;">&nbsp; Sanborn Atlases were originally made in the 1920's and rather than make a new atlas every year the company sent out updates in the form of paper which was cut and pasted on each page depending on new developments etc. Sanborn Atlases were large, the scale was an inch for a 100 feet. It is hard to tell with the Sanborns when they were last updated. Many of the atlases are not marked as to the exact year. They were used till the early 1960's.  </p>
